#### nnnock #####

An naive, unoptimized implementation of the [Urbit project](http://www.urbit.org)'s Nock VM in Scala. Because, why not?

For the core implementation, see here.

For a quick program testing the examples given with the [spec](http://www.urbit.org/2013/08/22/Chapter-2-nock.html), see here.

To run the test program, just download sbt and run `sbt run` from the base directory of this repository.
